The dataset contains the following relevant columns:

InvoiceNo: Could be used like an order_id

InvoiceDate: Date and time of the order

Quantity and UnitPrice: Can be used to calculate revenue

No explicit amount column, but we can compute it as Quantity * UnitPrice
  
Letâ€™s now create the MySQL to:

1.Extract year and month from InvoiceDate

2.Calculate total revenue

3.Count distinct invoices (order volume)

4.Group by year and month

5.Sort by year and month

SELECT
    YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(InvoiceDate, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i')) AS year,
    MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(InvoiceDate, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i')) AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS order_volume
FROM
    online_sales
GROUP BY
    YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(InvoiceDate, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i')),
    MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(InvoiceDate, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i'))
ORDER BY
    year, month;
