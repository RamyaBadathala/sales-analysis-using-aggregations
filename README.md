# 📊 Sales Analysis Using Aggregations

This project demonstrates how to use **SQL queries** to analyze sales data by applying **aggregations** and **time-based grouping**. It's ideal for beginners who want to practice grouping, filtering, and summarizing data.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

- 📅 How to **group sales data by time periods** (e.g., month, year)
- 🧾 How to **aggregate data** using SQL (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- 🧭 How to break down sales by **region**, **category**, or **customer**
- 🔎 How to identify trends and top contributors in sales data

## 📁 Project Structure

sql_query/
├── sales_by_month.sql # Grouping and aggregating monthly sales
├── sales_by_category.sql # Summarizing sales by product category
├── sales_by_region.sql # Analyzing regional sales distribution
├── top_customers.sql # Finding high-value customers
├── total_sales.sql # Calculating total sales across all orders

## 🧪 Sample Query (Time Trend Analysis)

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_sales
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    order_month
ORDER BY 
    order_month;
💡 This query groups sales data by month and shows the total sales per month, helping you analyze trends over time.

📦 Prerequisites
